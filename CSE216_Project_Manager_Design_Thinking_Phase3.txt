1. Is our app easy to use?
Yes, only too many pop up windows. But the functions are all working and 
2. What is confusing about our app?
We named users’ post as ‘event’ but there is no restriction on what to post, it might be confusing to users between upcoming events and the posts in the app. 
3. What features/functions would you like to add/take away from our current version?
Be able to buy tickets or have a link to the website that can purchase tickets. List events in chronological order (not based on posting time but on the event happening date). A search function in the navbar as well. 
4. Would you like to use our app? Why or why not?
Yes/No. Yes for concert lover because it is easier to find events if we have enough 
5. Is there any way to simplify our app idea?
