Google OAuth work flow (phase3):
    1. Front-end sends an authenticate token to backend /login
    2. Backend access user email using the access token
    3. Backend checks whether a user with the given email exists in our
       own database (if not, create a new user) and generates a session
       key
    4. Backend sents user info (includes uid, email, session key, etc)
       back to front-end
