Google OAuth work flow (phase3):
    1. Frontend/android sends an authenticate code to backend /callback
    2. Backend use the authenticate code to exchange for an access token,
       which will be sent to backend /login
    3. Backend access user email using the access token
    4. Backend checks whether a user with the given email exists in our
       own database (if not, create a new user) and generates a session
       key
